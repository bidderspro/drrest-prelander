                The <span className="font-bold">Verified Buyers Guide</span> is a trusted resource for practical, no-nonsense sleep
                advice, founded by Dr. Stephen Taylor â€” a 52 year old
                physician who personally battled years of snoring, CPAP
                frustration, and restless nights.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-3">
                After seeing how poor sleep was stealing energy and health from both his
                patients and himself, Dr. Taylor made it his mission to
                find solutions that actually work for people over 45.
                Today, Verified Buyers Guide brings together hands-on
                testing, medical insight, and real-world experience to
                help readers breathe easier, sleep deeper, and wake up
                with energy they thought they'd lost for good.
